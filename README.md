## Start of Responsive web design
```
Padding: 
Border:
margin:
```

An element's `padding` controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.

An element's `margin` controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

CSS allows you to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the ` padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom`, and `padding-left`  properties.

To change the CSS of a certain group of items use [attr=value] like [type="radio"]

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. 
For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. 
If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.

To define a variable in HTML use
--[variable-name]: e.g color;


To use it in CSS add this;
var(--[variable name])
```
Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.
```

Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes the following values, in order:

    offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
    offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
    blur-radius
    spread-radius
    color
e.g box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);


`The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.`

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me":
```
    Value	Result
    lowercase	"transform me"
    uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
    capitalize	"Transform Me"
    initial	Use the default value
    inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
    none	Default: Use the original text
```
## Relative
When the position of an element is set to `relative`, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of `left` or `right`, and `top` or `bottom`. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned.
## Absolute
The next option for the CSS position property is `absolute`, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties `(top or bottom and left or right)` are used to adjust the position.
## Float
The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.

## Gradients
    to greate gradients use:
`background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);`
example:
`background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));`

## @keyframes

```
  #rect {
    animation-name: rainbow; <!-- Name of the @keyframes down the lines -->
    animation-duration: 4s; <!-- Duration of the keyframe -->

  }

  @keyframes rainbow { <!-- Start of the keyframes, start middle and end. -->
    0% {
      background-color: blue;
    }
    50% {
      background-color: green;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
  }
```

Use `animation-fill-mode: forwards;` to keep the animation after animation has ran
Use `animation-iteration-count: 3;Â´ to run the animation as many times as you want

animation-timing-function: linear;
animation-timing-function: ease-out;

Audio Player on website
```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
```

## Accesibility

Date picker: input type="date"

## Media queries

@media (max-width: 100px) {
p {
text-size: 10px;
}
}

## Flexbox

Placing the CSS property `display: flex;` on an element allows you to use other flex properties to build a responsive page
```
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: column;
```
# justify-content

There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of the most commonly used is `justify-content: center;`, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside the flex container. Other options include:

    `flex-start:` aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container. This is the default alignment if no justify-content is specified.
    
   ` flex-end:` aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.
   
    `space-between:` aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the remaining space is distributed evenly among the other items.
    
    `space-around:` similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items with a half space on either end of the flex container.
    
    vspace-evenly:` Distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at either end of the flex container.
    
# align-items    
CSS offers the align-items property to align flex items along the cross axis. For a row, it tells CSS how to push the items in the entire row up or down within the container. And for a column, how to push all the items left or right within the container.

The different values available for align-items include:

   `flex-start:` aligns items to the start of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the top of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.
   
    `flex-end:` aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the bottom of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the right of the container.
    
    `center:` align items to the center. For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal space above and below the items). For columns, this horizontally aligns them (equal space to the left and right of the items).
    
   `stretch:` stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom. This is the default value if no align-items value is specified.
   
   `baseline:` align items to their baselines. Baseline is a text concept, think of it as the line that the letters sit on.
    
# wrap

CSS also has options for the direction of the wrap:

   `nowrap:` this is the default setting, and does not wrap items.
   `wrap:` wraps items onto multiple lines from top-to-bottom if they are in rows and left-to-right if they are in columns.
   `wrap-reverse:` wraps items onto multiple lines from bottom-to-top if they are in rows and right-to-left if they are in columns.
